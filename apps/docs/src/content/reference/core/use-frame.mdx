This hook allows you to execute code on every frame as part of the unified frameloop.
You receive the state (the same as [`useThrelte`](/docs/reference/core/hooks#usethrelte)) and a clock delta in seconds.
Your callback function will be invoked just before a frame is rendered. When the component unmounts it is unsubscribed automatically from the frame loop.

You may pass additional options to this hook. The property `order` is useful if you need to order the sequence of `useFrame` callbacks across the component tree where callbacks are ordered from low to high. To debug your frameloop, provide a `debugFrameloopMessage` and add `debugFrameloop` to your [`<Canvas>`](/docs/reference/core/canvas) component.

```ts
type ThrelteUseFrameOptions = {
  autostart?: boolean
  order?: number
  debugFrameloopMessage?: string
  invalidate?: boolean
}
```

`useFrame` returns an object containing functions `start` and `stop` to control the execution of the callback and a store `started` to subscribe to its state.

### Example

Starting and stopping the execution of a frameloop handler:

```ts
const { start, stop, started } = useFrame(
  () => {
    console.log('renderingâ€¦')
  },
  {
    autostart: false
  }
)

const toggleUseFrame = () => {
  if ($started) {
    stop()
  } else {
    start()
  }
}
```

Accessing the context and the global clocks delta inside a frameloop handler:

```ts
useFrame(({ camera }, delta) => {
  const cameraPosition = camera.current.position
})
```

<Tip type="tip">
  The state available in the callback is the same as the one available with <code>useThrelte</code>.
  Some properties (such as the property `camera`) use a `CurrentWritable` store. which is a custom
  Threlte store. It's a regular writable store that also has a `current` property which is the
  current value of the store. It's useful for accessing the value of a store in a non-reactive
  context, such as in loops.
</Tip>

By default, `useFrame` will invalidate every frame and trigger a render after the callback is executed. You can disable this behavior by setting `invalidate` to `false` and using the function `invalidate` from the state to trigger a render manually.

```ts
useFrame(
  ({ invalidate }) => {
    // manually invalidate the frame
    invalidate()
  },
  {
    invalidate: false
  }
)
```
