<Tip type="info">
	Tasks are part of Threlte's *Task Scheduling System*.

</Tip>

The hook `useTask` is used to create a
[task](/docs/learn/basics/scheduling-tasks#tasks) that is used to run code on
every frame.

## Creating an Anonymous Task

In its most basic form, `useTask` takes a function as its first argument. This
function will be executed on every frame, starting on the next frame and
receives the delta time representing the time since the last frame as its first
argument. By default, the created task is added to [Threlte's
`mainStage`](#default-stages) in an arbitrary order (i.e. without dependencies).

```ts
const { start, stop, started, task } = useTask((delta) => {
  // This function will be executed on every frame
})
```

It returns an object with the following properties:
- `start`: A function that starts the task. It will be executed on the next
  frame. Note that by default a task is started automatically.
- `stop`: A function that stops the task. It will not be executed on the next
  frame.
- `started`: A boolean Svelte `Readable` store indicating whether the task is
  started or not.
- `task`: The task itself. You can use it to indicate a dependency to this task
  on another task.

## Creating a Keyed Task

You can *key* a task by passing it as the first argument to `useTask`. This
makes referencing this task easier across your app. The key can be any `string`
or `symbol` value that is unique across all tasks in the stage it is added to.

```ts
const { start, stop, started, task: someTask } = useTask('some-task', (delta) => {
  // This function will be executed on every frame
})
```

## Creating a Task in a Stage

You can also pass a stage that the task should be added to as an option to
`useTask`:

```ts
useTask((delta) => {
  // This function will be executed on every frame as a
  // task in the stage `afterRenderStage`.
}, { stage: afterRenderStage })
```

## Task Dependencies

A common use case for tasks is to run code after another task has been executed. Imagine
a game where an object is transformed by user input in one task and a camera follows that
object in another task. The camera task should be executed after the object has been
transformed.

To control the order in which tasks are executed in a stage, you can pass a
`before` and `after` option to `useTask`. The tasks passed to these options are
called **dependencies** and can be a task itself, the key of a task or an array
of tasks or keys. The referenced tasks must be in the same stage as the task you
are creating.

Task dependencies **do not need to be created yet** if they are passed by key.
The declared dependencies will be taken into account when they are created later
on.

<Tip type="warning">
	If a task is passed by reference to the `before` or `after` option, the task
	created by `useTask` will automatically be added to the same stage as the task
	it depends on. If you pass a key instead and the task you want to reference is
	**not** in [Threlte's `mainStage`](#default-stages), you will also need to pass the
	stage, either by value or key.

## Examples

### Update Objects

To update objects in your scene, you can use the `useTask` hook to create a task
that is executed on every frame. The delta time is passed as the first argument
to make animations frame rate independent.

```svelte
<script>
	import { T, useTask } from '@threlte/core'
	import { Mesh } from 'svelte-three'

	let mesh

	useTask((delta) => {
		if (!mesh) return
		mesh.rotation.y += delta * 0.5
	})
</script>

<T.Mesh bind:ref={mesh}>
	<T.BoxGeometry />
</T.Mesh>
```

### Custom Render Pipeline

To create a custom render pipeline, add a task to Threlte's `renderStage` which
by default only runs its tasks when a re-render is needed. Be sure to set the
property `renderMode` to `'manual'` on the `<Canvas>` component.

```svelte title="CustomRenderer.svelte"
<script>
	import { useTask } from '@threlte/core'

	const { renderStage } = useThrelte()

	useTask((delta) => {
		// render your scene here
	}, { stage: renderStage })
</script>
```
