The `useStudio` hook allows you to access the Theatre.js studio object. 


## Usage

Unlike most Threlte hooks, this is *not* a context hook, which means it can be used anywhere in your app.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { useStudio } from '@threlte/theatre'
	const studio = useStudio();
</script>
```
