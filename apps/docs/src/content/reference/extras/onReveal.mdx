`onReveal` invokes a callback when the component is revealed (i.e., no
longer suspended in the context of a [`<Suspense>`](/docs/reference/extras/suspense) boundary). It mimics Svelte's
lifecycle method `onMount`. If there is no `<Suspense>` component, the callback
will be executed with Svelte's `onMount` as the component will never suspend.

## Example

The following component loads a model with the hook `useGltf` and is potentially
wrapped in a `<Suspense>` boundary.

```svelte
<script>
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
  import { onReveal, useGltf } from '@threlte/extras'

  const gltf = useGltf('model.gltf')

  onReveal(() => {
    console.log('The component has been revealed')
  })
</script>

{#await gltf then { scene }}
  <T is={scene}>
{/await}
```

<Tip type="tip">
	`onReveal` is mimicking Svelte's `onMount` and can
	be used in its place for triggering animations, etc., within the boundaries
	of a `<Suspense>` component. If it's used outside of a `<Suspense>` component,
	it will behave just like Svelte's `onMount`.
