`<TrackballControls>` TrackballControls is similar to OrbitControls. However, it does not maintain a constant camera up vector. That means if the camera orbits over the “north” and “south” poles, it does not flip to stay "right side up"

The component `<TrackballControls>` must be a direct child of a camera component and will mount itself to that camera.
By default, damping is enabled. You can disable this by setting `staticMoving` to true.

When using TrackballControls, the frame loop will run continously. Note that unlike OrbitControls, TrackballControls does not support `autoRotate`.

## Usage

```svelte
<script>
  import { TrackballControls } from '@threlte/extras'
  import { T } from '@threlte/core'
</script>

`

<T.PerspectiveCamera
  makeDefault
  fov={50}
>
  <TrackballControls />
</T.PerspectiveCamera>
```

`<TrackballControls>` is a light wrapper that will use its parent as the target camera and the DOM element
the renderer is rendering to as the DOM element to listen to. It will also by demand invalidate the frame loop
and will run the frame loop continuously.
