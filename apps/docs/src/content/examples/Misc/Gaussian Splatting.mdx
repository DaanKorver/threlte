[3D Gaussian Splatting](https://huggingface.co/blog/gaussian-splatting) is a
rasterization technique that allows to render 3D objects with a high level of
detail. It's a technology that is currently quickly gaining popularity because
of the photorealistic rendering of 3D scan data. This example shows how to
implement 3D Gaussian Splatting with the help of two libraries:

- [`@lumaai/luma-web`](https://lumalabs.ai/luma-web-library) by [Luma](https://lumalabs.ai/)
- [`@pmndrs/vanilla`](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei-vanilla)

<Tip type="experimental">
  The technology presented in this example is rapidly developing and therefore the components are
  not part of the [`@threlte/extras`](/docs/reference/extras/getting-started) package *as of now*.
  You may however copy and paste them into your project and use them as you wish.
