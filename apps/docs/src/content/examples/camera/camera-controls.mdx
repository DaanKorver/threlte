You may have come up against limitations with `<OrbitalControls/>` from three.js. [Camera Controls](https://github.com/yomotsu/camera-controls) is an existing project which supports smooth transitions, has many more features and is a good replacement.

Below is a component with a basic implementation of camera-controls equivelant to this [example](https://yomotsu.github.io/camera-controls/examples/basic.html). Your project may need only specific features in which case copy the component, [revisit their docs](https://github.com/yomotsu/camera-controls) and adjust to code to suit your projects needs.
