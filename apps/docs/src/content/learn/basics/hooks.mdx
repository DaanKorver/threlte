Hooks allow you to tie or request specific information to your component. For instance, components
that want to participate in the unified frame loop can use `useFrame`, components that need to be informed
of your main Threlte application context can use `useThrelte` and so on. All hooks clean up after themselves
once the component unmounts and can only be used in a child of the `<Canvas>` component.

Here is an overview of the `@theatre/core` hooks:

- [useThrelte](/docs/reference/core/use-threlte) - gain access to the core ThreeJS context, including `renderer`, `scene`, `camera` and more.
- [useFrame](/docs/reference/core/use-frame) - allows hooking into the core frameloop, enable animations and other dynamic behavior.
- [useRender](/docs/reference/core/use-render) - allows hooking into the rendering process and even hook custom postprocessing into your app.
- [useLoader](/docs/reference/core/use-loader) - load data with an arbitrary ThreeJS loader classes.

A variety of other hooks are provided by the other Threlte package. See [the reference documentation](/docs/learn/getting-started/introduction) to discover more hooks.
