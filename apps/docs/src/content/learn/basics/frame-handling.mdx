In 3D apps and games, a lot of work is done in functions that run on every
frame. In Threlte, these functions are called **tasks**. Tasks are grouped into
**stages** and may follow a specific order. Stages may be executed in a specific
order as well. Everything is managed by the **scheduler**. In this section, we
will learn how to use the scheduler, what stages are and how to create them and
how to use tasks to run code on every frame.

## Scheduler

Every Threlte app has a single scheduler. It is accessible via [`useThrelte()`](/docs/reference/core/use-threlte):

```ts
const { scheduler } = useThrelte()
```

<Tip type="info">
  Most of the times you won't need to interact with the scheduler directly. It is
  used internally by Threlte to run all the tasks. However, you can use it to
  create stages and run tasks manually.
</Tip>

## Stages

Stages are **groups of tasks**. They are executed in a specific order.

### Default Stages

By default, Threlte will create two stages for you:
- A default stage: This stage holds all the tasks that are not assigned to any other stage.
- A render stage: This stage will be executed after the default stage. It is
  used to render the scene and only ever executes its tasks when the a re-render
  is needed.

These two stages are created automatically and are accessible via
[`useThrelte()`](/docs/reference/core/use-threlte):

```ts
const { defaultStage, renderStage } = useThrelte()
```

### Creating a Stage

Sometimes, you may want to create your own stage, for instance to run tasks
after rendering. You can do so by using the hook `useStage`. The hook will
create a stage if it does not exist yet, or return the existing stage if it
does.

```ts
const { renderStage } = useThrelte()

const afterRenderStage = useStage('after-render', {
  after: renderStage
})
```

All tasks added to the stage `afterRenderStage` will be executed after the tasks
of the stage `renderStage`.

<Tip type="tip">
  Be aware that `useStage` never removes a stage as that's usually not needed.
</Tip>

A stage decides **when and how its tasks are executed**. By default, a stage will
execute its tasks on every frame. You can change this behavior by passing a
`callback` option to `useStage`. This callback will be called every frame. The
first argument `delta` is the time elapsed since the last frame. The second
argument `runTasks` is a function that when invoked will run all the tasks of
the stage in their respective order. You can use it to run the tasks only when
needed (e.g. when a condition is met) or to run them multiple times. If a number
is passed as the first argument to runTasks, the tasks will receive that as the
delta.

```ts
const { renderStage } = useThrelte()

const conditionalStage = useStage('after-render', {
  after: renderStage,
  callback: (delta, runTasks) => {
      // This callback will be called every frame. The first argument is the time elapsed
      // since the last frame. The second argument is a function that will run all the
      // tasks of the stage. You can use it to run the tasks only when needed (e.g. when
      // a condition is met) or to run them multiple times. If a number is passed as the
      // first argument to runTasks, the tasks will receive that as the delta.
      if (condition) {
        runTasks()
      }
    }
})
```

### Removing a Stage

You can remove a stage by calling the `remove` method of the scheduler. The first
argument is the stage or the key of the stage to remove.

```ts
const { scheduler } = useThrelte()

scheduler.removeStage(afterRenderStage)
```

<Tip>
	Be aware that removing a stage will also remove all the tasks in that stage. Usually, you
	won't need to remove a stage.
</Tip>

## Tasks

Tasks are functions that are executed on every frame. They are grouped in
stages. You can add a task to a stage by using the hook `useTask`. The hook will
create a task and add it to a stage.

### Creating an Anonymous Task

In its most basic form, `useTask` takes a function as its first argument. This
function will be executed on every frame, starting on the next frame. By
default, the created task is added to Threlte's default stage in an arbitrary
order.

```ts
const { start, stop, started, task } = useTask((delta) => {
  // This function will be executed on every frame
})
```

It returns an object with the following properties:
- `start`: A function that starts the task. It will be executed on the next
  frame. Note that by default a task is started automatically.
- `stop`: A function that stops the task. It will not be executed on the next
  frame.
- `started`: A boolean Svelte `Readable` store indicating whether the task is
  started or not.
- `task`: The task itself. You can use it to indicate a dependency of this task
  on another task.


### Creating a Keyed Task

You can key a task by passing it as first argument to `useTask`. This makes
referencing this task easier across your app. The key can be any `string` or
`symbol` value or that is unique across all tasks in a stage.

```ts
const { start, stop, started, task: someTask } = useTask('some-task', (delta) => {
  // This function will be executed on every frame
})
```

### Creating a Task in a Stage

You can also pass a stage that the task should be added to as an option to
`useTask`:

```ts
useTask((delta) => {
  // This function will be executed on every frame as a
  // task in the stage `afterRenderStage`.
}, { stage: afterRenderStage })
```

### Task Dependencies

A common use case for tasks is to run code after another task has been executed. Imagine
a game where an object is transformed by user input in one task and a camera follows that
object in another task. The camera task should be executed after the object has been
transformed.

To control the order in which tasks are executed in a stage, you can pass a
`before` and `after` option to `useTask` The tasks passed to these options are
called **dependencies** and can be a task itself, the key of a task or an array
of tasks or keys. The referenced tasks must be in the same stage as the task you
are creating.

#### Examples

```ts
// Execute a task after a single task passed by reference
useTask((delta) => {
  // …
}, { after: someTask })
```

```ts
// Execute a task after a single task passed by key
useTask((delta) => {
  // …
}, { after: 'some-task' })
```

```ts
// Execute a task after multiple tasks passed by reference
useTask((delta) => {
  // …
}, { after: [someTask, someOtherTask] })
```

```ts
// Execute a task after a certain task but before another one
useTask((delta) => {
  // …
}, { after: someTask, before: someOtherTask })
```

Task dependencies **do not need to be created yet** if they are passed by key.
The declared dependencies will be taken into account when they are created later
on.

<Tip type="warning">
  If a task is passed by reference to the `before` or `after` option, the task
  created by `useTask` will automatically be added to the same stage as the
  task it depends on. If you pass a key instead and the task you want to reference
  is not in Threlte's default stage, you will also need to pass the stage, either
  by value or key.
